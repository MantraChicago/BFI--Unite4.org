        h4 About:
        p (character limit) My name is Samantha Abernathy, and I love pancakes a whole lot. In fact, I love them so much that I once built a bike with two pancakes for wheels. Speaking of loving pancakes, love is a funny thing. Some people see it as an uphill bike ride, but I see it more as breakfast on the go. Don’t get me wrong.. I do believe in love. But there’s really just no time for chitchat when there are two hot banana pancakes to be eaten.
